### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a master student at TUM learning robotics, cognition and intelligence. 

Currently new to the field of humaniod robotics and ready to explore it! I want to explore the possibility to combine artificial intelligence to build better robots! 

In the meantime, I'm also a great enthusiatist to the open source software and linux. I'm a daily Archlinux user and like all sorts of fun stuff from self-hosting.
