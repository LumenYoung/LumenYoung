# Lumen Young

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

For a strange reason you have came across my personal page. Thank you for visiting anyway!

I'm currently a master student at Technical University of Munich. I'm studying Robotics, Cognition and Intelligence and my main interest is to explore the possibility to combine artificial intelligence to build better robots! Currently I'm writing my Master Thesis at Robot Learning lab in University of Freiburg.

In the meantime, I'm also an enthusiatist to the open source software and linux. I'm a daily Archlinux user and like all sorts of fun stuff from self-hosting. I appreciate all the amazing open-source softwares, allow me to enjoy all the convenience offered by modern softwares while maintaining a personal space that I can call my own.
